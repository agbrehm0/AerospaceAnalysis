Since I am currently working for UTC Aerospace Systems through QuEST Global, I thought it would be a good idea to have a project with the goal of helping predict aircraft part failure. My first thought is to use information from aviation-safety.net/database which has records of crashes from 1919-2018. This database also has features where you can access crashes based on other attributes, such as aircraft type, geography, causes, airlines, and airports. The data I am interested in will come from the Causes index. There can be several causes for a plane crash so the database breaks the Causes index up even further. Since I am only interested in causes involving machinery failure, I will use the AIRPLANE index. From here - https://aviation-safety.net/database/events/event.php?code=AC - I want to start scraping the data. However, I am not entirely sure where to start...
